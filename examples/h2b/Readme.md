H2B Example
-----------

Fake responses are being used because this test example does not have a backend connection with the bot. There is a delay of 1 second between each response.

All functionality should be the same as with a regular bot. If you take this and convert it to production, be sure to edit the h2bStore.js to use the actual bot.
